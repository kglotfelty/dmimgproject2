<SYNOPSIS>
	Project image along rotated axis   
</SYNOPSIS>
<DESC>
<PARA>

	'dmimgproject2' projects data along the rotated X-axis.  To project 
    along the Y-axis, use angle=90.  The projection includes several 
    statistics computed from the pixels along the projected axis including:
    sum, mean (average), count, median, min, max, sigma (standard deviation),
    several quantiles (25,33,67,and 75%), and more.
    The output table contains the X and Y coordinates for the X-axis 
    in the rotated reference frame.      
</PARA>
<PARA>
    The binsize is in units of logical (image) pixels.  The binsize
    is adjusted internally for the rotation angle.  So for example, using
    a binsize=1 with a rotation angle of 45 degrees will adjust the
    bin width used internally to include a single pixel width in the
    rotated coordinate system.
</PARA>
<PARA>
    There is a second image extension added to the output, the "GRID_IMG",
    which shows which pixels are included in each projection grid.
</PARA>

<PARA>
        Image pixels that fall outside and region subspace are
        excluded as are any NaN or integer NULL values.

<PARA>

     Project the exposure image onto the Y-axis.  Pixels outside the 
     circle are not included in the integral.  The "count" column 
     will include the number of pixels in each grid.

<PARAM def="0" min="0" max="180" name="angle" reqd="yes" type="real">
<SYNOPSIS>

The rotation angle.    
</SYNOPSIS>
<DESC>
<PARA>
    The X-axis rotated by this many degrees before the projection
    is computed.

</PARAM>
<PARAM name="binsize" def="1" min="0" type="real"> 
<SYNOPSIS>
The binsize of the projection bins, in logical|image pixels.
</SYNOPSIS>
<DESC>
  <PARA>
  The binsize of the projection histogram bins. This is measured in
  logical|image pixels.  
  </PARA>
  <PARA>
  Internally, the binsize is adjusted for the rotation angle.  For
  example, if the rotation angle is 45 degrees, then binsize=1
  is adjusted so that rotated grid maintains a width of 1 image pixel.
